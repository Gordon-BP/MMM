# Meaningful Model Metrics
Meaningful Model Metrics (MMM) is a data analysis tool for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. This repo follows along my blog post at LINK. A hosted version is also accessible via streamlit cloud at LINK.

While the data measurements will work on any CSV data, performance testing is designed to work with (Botpress)[https://www.botpress.com], and open-source chatbot framework. It's possible to modify the performance code to work with other chatbot frameworks- see the comments in (test.py)[/test.py] for more information.
